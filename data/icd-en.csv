Flashbacks may be distinguished from psychotic state partly by their episodic nature, frequently of very short duration, and by their duplication of previous alcohol- or other psychoactive substance-related experiences.	A disorder in which alcohol- or psychoactive substance-induced changes of cognition, affect, personality, or behaviour persist beyond the period during which a direct psychoactive substance-related effect might reasonably be assumed to be operating. Onset of the disorder should be directly related to the use of the psychoactive substance. Cases in which initial onset of the state occurs later than episode(s) of such substance use should be coded here only where clear and strong evidence is available to attribute the state to the residual effect of the psychoactive substance.

2609	II	introduction	PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP	Notes#1.#Primary, ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites of malignant neoplasm#Categories C76−C80 include malignant neoplasms for which there is no clear indication of the original site of the cancer or the cancer is stated to be 'disseminated', 'scattered' or 'spread' without mention of the primary site. In both cases the primary site is considered to be unknown.#2.#Functional activity#All neoplasms are classified in this chapter, whether they are functionally active or not. An additional code from Chapter IV may be used, if desired, to identify functional activity associated with any neoplasm. For example, catecholamine-producing malignant phaeochromocytoma of adrenal gland should be coded to C74 with additional code E27.5; basophil adenoma of pituitary gland with Cushing syndrome should be coded to D35.2 with additional code E24.0.#3.#Morphology#There are a number of major morphological (histological) groups of malignant neoplasms: carcinomas including squamous (cell) and adenocarcinomas; sarcomas; other soft tissue tumours including mesotheliomas; lymphomas (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin); leukaemia; other specified and site-specific types; and unspecified cancers. Cancer is a generic term and may be used for any of the above groups, although it is rarely applied to the malignant neoplasms of lymphatic, haematopoietic and related tissue. 'Carcinoma' is sometimes used incorrectly as a synonym for 'cancer'.#In Chapter II neoplasms are classified predominantly by site within broad groupings for behaviour. In a few exceptional cases morphology is indicated in the category and subcategory titles.#For those wishing to identify the histological type of neoplasm, comprehensive separate morphology codes are provided (see section Morphology of neoplasms). These morphology codes are derived from the second edition of International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICDO), which is a dual-axis classification providing independent coding systems for topography and morphology. Morphology codes have six digits: the first four digits identify the histological type; the fifth digit is the behaviour code (malignant primary, malignant secondary (metastatic), in situ, benign, uncertain whether malignant or benign); and the sixth digit is a grading code (differentiation) for solid tumours, and is also used as a special code for lymphomas and leukaemias.#4.#Use of subcategories in Chapter II#Attention is drawn to the special use of subcategory .8 in this chapter [see note 5]. Where it has been necessary to provide subcategories for 'other', these have generally been designated as subcategory .7.#5.#Malignant neoplasms overlapping site boundaries and the use of subcategory .8 (overlapping lesion)#Categories C00−C75 classify primary malignant neoplasms according to their point of origin. Many three-character categories are further divided into named parts or subcategories of the organ in question. A neoplasm that overlaps two or more contiguous sites within a three-character category and whose point of origin cannot be determined should be classified to the subcategory .8 ("overlapping lesion"), unless the combination is specifically indexed elsewhere. For example, carcinoma of oesophagus and stomach is specifically indexed to C16.0 (cardia), while carcinoma of the tip and ventral surface of the tongue should be assigned to C02.8. On the other hand, carcinoma of the tip of the tongue extending to involve the ventral surface should be coded to C02.1 as the point of origin, the tip, is known. 'Overlapping' implies that the sites involved are contiguous (next to each other). Numerically consecutive subcategories are frequently anatomically contiguous, but this is not invariably so (e.g. bladder C67.−) and the coder may need to consult anatomical texts to determine the topographical relationships.#Sometimes a neoplasm overlaps the boundaries of three-character categories within certain systems. To take care of this the following subcategories have been designated:# C02.8#Overlapping lesion of tongue# C08.8#Overlapping lesion of major salivary glands# C14.8#Overlapping lesion of lip, oral cavity and pharynx# C21.8#Overlapping lesion of rectum, anus and anal canal# C24.8#Overlapping lesion of biliary tract# C26.8#Overlapping lesion of digestive system# C39.8#Overlapping lesion of respiratory and intrathoracic organs# C41.8#Overlapping lesion of bone and articular cartilage# C49.8#Overlapping lesion of connective and soft tissue# C57.8#Overlapping lesion of female genital organs# C63.8#Overlapping lesion of male genital organs# C68.8#Overlapping lesion of urinary organs# C72.8#Overlapping lesion of central nervous system#An example of this is a carcinoma of the stomach and small intestine, which should be coded to C26.8 (Overlapping lesion of digestive system).#6.#Malignant neoplasms of ectopic tissue#Malignant neoplasms of ectopic tissue are to be coded to the site where they are found, e.g. ectopic pancreatic malignant neoplasms of ovary are coded to ovary (C56).#7.#Use of the Alphabetical Index in coding neoplasms#In addition to site, morphology and behaviour must also be taken into consideration when coding neoplasms, and reference should always be made first to the Alphabetical Index entry for the morphological description.#The introductory pages of Volume 3 include general instructions about the correct use of the Alphabetical Index. The specific instructions and examples pertaining to neoplasms should be consulted to ensure correct use of the categories and subcategories in Chapter II.#8.#Use of the second edition of International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O)#For certain morphological types, Chapter II provides a rather restricted topographical classification, or none at all. The topography codes of ICD-O use for all neoplasms essentially the same three- and four-character categories that Chapter II uses for malignant neoplasms (C00−C77, C80), thus providing increased specificity of site for other neoplasms (malignant secondary (metastatic), benign, in situ and uncertain or unknown).#It is therefore recommended that agencies interested in identifying both the site and morphology of tumours, e.g. cancer registries, cancer hospitals, pathology departments and other agencies specializing in cancer, use ICD-O.	Notes#1.#Primary, ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites of malignant neoplasm#Categories C76−C80 include malignant neoplasms for which there is no clear indication of the original site of the cancer or the cancer is stated to be 'disseminated', 'scattered' or 'spread' without mention of the primary site. In both cases the primary site is considered to be unknown.#2.#Functional activity#All neoplasms are classified in this chapter, whether they are functionally active or not. An additional code from Chapter IV may be used, if desired, to identify functional activity associated with any neoplasm. For example, catecholamine-producing malignant phaeochromocytoma of adrenal gland should be coded to C74 with additional code E27.5; basophil adenoma of pituitary gland with Cushing syndrome should be coded to D35.2 with additional code E24.0.#3.#Morphology#There are a number of major morphological (histological) groups of malignant neoplasms: carcinomas including squamous (cell) and adenocarcinomas; sarcomas; other soft tissue tumours including mesotheliomas; lymphomas (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin); leukaemia; other specified and site-specific types; and unspecified cancers.

Although less severe psychosocial stress ("life events") may precipitate the onset or contribute to the presentation of a very wide range of disorders classified elsewhere in this chapter, its etiological importance is not always clear and in each case will be found to depend on individual, often idiosyncratic, vulnerability, i.e. the life events are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the occurrence and form of the disorder. In contrast, the disorders brought together here are thought to arise always as a direct consequence of acute severe stress or continued trauma. The stressful events or the continuing unpleasant circumstances are the primary and overriding causal factor and the disorder would not have occurred without their impact. The disorders in this section can thus be regarded as maladaptive responses to severe or continued stress, in that they interfere with successful coping mechanisms and therefore lead to problems of social functioning.

7168	F43.0	definition	P	A transient disorder that develops in an individual without any other apparent mental disorder in response to exceptional physical and mental stress and that usually subsides within hours or days. Individual vulnerability and coping capacity play a role in the occurrence and severity of acute stress reactions. The symptoms show a typically mixed and changing picture and include an initial state of "daze" with some constriction of the field of consciousness and narrowing of attention, inability to comprehend stimuli, and disorientation. This state may be followed either by further withdrawal from the surrounding situation (to the extent of a dissociative stupor - F44.2), or by agitation and over-activity (flight reaction or fugue). Autonomic signs of panic anxiety (tachycardia, sweating, flushing) are commonly present. The symptoms usually appear within minutes of the impact of the stressful stimulus or event, and disappear within two to three days (often within hours). Partial or complete amnesia (F44.0) for the episode may be present. If the symptoms persist, a change in diagnosis should be considered.

Predisposing factors, such as personality traits (e.g. compulsive, asthenic) or previous history of neurotic illness, may lower the threshold for the development of the syndrome or aggravate its course, but they are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain its occurrence. Typical features include episodes of repeated reliving of the trauma in intrusive memories ("flashbacks"), dreams or nightmares, occurring against the persisting background of a sense of "numbness" and emotional blunting, detachment from other people, unresponsiveness to surroundings, anhedonia, and avoidance of activities and situations reminiscent of the trauma. There is usually a state of autonomic hyperarousal with hypervigilance, an enhanced startle reaction, and insomnia. Anxiety and depression are commonly associated with the above symptoms and signs, and suicidal ideation is not infrequent. The onset follows the trauma with a latency period that may range from a few weeks to months. The course is fluctuating but recovery can be expected in the majority of cases. In a small proportion of cases the condition may follow a chronic course over many years, with eventual transition to an enduring personality change (F62.0).

All types of dissociative disorders tend to remit after a few weeks or months, particularly if their onset is associated with a traumatic life event. More chronic disorders, particularly paralyses and anaesthesias, may develop if the onset is associated with insoluble problems or interpersonal difficulties. These disorders have previously been classified as various types of "conversion hysteria". They are presumed to be psychogenic in origin, being associated closely in time with traumatic events, insoluble and intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. The symptoms often represent the patient's concept of how a physical illness would be manifest. Medical examination and investigation do not reveal the presence of any known physical or neurological disorder. In addition, there is evidence that the loss of function is an expression of emotional conflicts or needs. The symptoms may develop in close relationship to psychological stress, and often appear suddenly. Only disorders of physical functions normally under voluntary control and loss of sensations are included here. Disorders involving pain and other complex physical sensations mediated by the autonomic nervous system are classified under somatization disorder (F45.0). The possibility of the later appearance of serious physical or psychiatric disorders should always be kept in mind.
